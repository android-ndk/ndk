Android Native Development Kit (NDK)
====================================

Welcome, this NDK is designed to allow Android application developers to include
native code in their Android application packages, compiled as JNI shared
libraries.

See [the changelist](docs/CHANGES.html) for a list of changes since the previous
release.

A high-level overview of the NDK's features and limitations can be found in [the
overview](docs/OVERVIEW.html). Please read this document as it contains crucial
information for correct usage.

See [the stable API list](docs/STABLE-APIS.html) for the list of frozen binary
APIs exposed by this NDK, as well as the corresponding system image versions
that support them.

Before using the NDK, you will need to follow the steps described by [the
installation guide](docs/INSTALL.html) which lists the NDK prerequisites and the
steps needed to set it up properly on your machine.

We recommend developers to make themselves familiar with JNI concepts. Also note
that the NDK is **not** a good way to write non-JNI native code for the Android
platform.

See [the how-to](docs/HOWTO.html) for a few useful tips and tricks when using
the NDK.

[The system issues list](docs/SYSTEM-ISSUES.html) contains important issues
related to the Android system images that all NDK developers should be aware of.

Finally, discussions related to the Android NDK happen on the public
"android-ndk" forum located at the following address:
