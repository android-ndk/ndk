Where did the docs go?
----------------------

Some of the docs are now hosted online at https://developer.android.com/ndk/.
But a few are still located only in directory "docs/Additional_library_docs/".
In particular, to see the documentation for Android native audio based on OpenSL ES,
open a web browser for Additional_library_docs/opensles/index.html and reference PDF.
